we created a docker compose file and in that we uses services like a webserver,php, database and phpmyadmin.The server is called nginx, php is php:8-fpm, database is mariadb and phpmyadmin is phpmyadmin. In server we used nginx server with ports, link and volume and  php also is made of these.We linked server named nginx with php and on the localhost port(port of nginx that we made in server section) shows the content of php. After that we connect our database with PhpMyAdmin. In database we set an environment with creditial.
